## Introduction

The **SuperMarket Billing System** is a Python program that simulates a simple supermarket's billing process. It provides users with the ability to view available items, select the items they want to buy, and generate a bill for the selected items.

## Project Goals

1. **Functionality and Interface:**
   Create a Python-based SuperMarket Billing System with functions for item display, user interaction, and bill generation, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user interface.

2. **Data Handling and Calculation:**
   Implement logic to handle item selection, quantity input, total price calculation, and GST application for generating accurate and detailed bills.

3. **User Experience and Readability:**
   Prioritize a user-friendly design, error handling, and clear instructions for smooth navigation, enhancing code readability and modularity for future improvements.

4. **Educational Tool and Documentation:**
   Offer an educational resource for Python learners, showcasing best practices, providing in-code explanations, and serving as a practical example for programming and software understanding.

## Functionality of Project.

### 1. Display Available Items

The program begins by welcoming the user and displaying a list of available items along with their prices per unit or per kilogram/liter. This allows users to make informed decisions about what they want to purchase.

### 2. Item Selection

After viewing the available items, users can choose the items they want to buy by entering the item name. The program validates the input and allows the user to specify the quantity for each item. The user can continue to add more items to their purchase list.

### 3. Bill Generation

Once the user has finished selecting items, the program calculates the total price for the selected items, applies a 5% GST tax, and generates a final bill. The bill displays a detailed breakdown of the purchased items, quantities, prices, total amount, and GST.

## User Experience

Users can easily navigate the program using a simple text-based user interface (UI). They are prompted with clear instructions and options at each step, making the program intuitive to use.

- **View Available Items:**
  Users can choose to view the available items and their prices by selecting the appropriate option.

- **Select Items:**
  Users can select the items they wish to purchase and specify the quantities for each item. The program validates user input to ensure accuracy.

- **Generate Bill:**
  Users can choose to generate a bill for the selected items. The bill provides a detailed summary of the purchase.

## Target Audience

- Shoppers seeking a streamlined shopping process.
- Learners exploring Python programming and software basics.
- Anyone interested in an intuitive supermarket billing example.

## Workflow

1. **Welcome and Display Options:**
   The program begins with a welcome message and displays the options to view available items or buy items.

2. **View Available Items:**
   If the user chooses to view available items, the program displays a list of items and their prices.

3. **Buy Items:**
   If the user chooses to buy items, they can enter the items and quantities they want to purchase. The program validates the input and calculates the prices.

4. **Generate Bill:**
   Once the user is done selecting items, they can choose to generate a bill. The program calculates the total price, applies GST, and displays the final bill.

5. **Exit:**
   The user can choose to exit the program at any point.
